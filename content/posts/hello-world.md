Hello World!

The perfect sequence of characters to kick off any technical blog if you ask me.

My name is Pascal and I would like to welcome you to my little corner of the web.
I have been meaning to start a blog for some years now but, somehow I never got around to actually doing it.

I have not written an article online until very recently when I was going for my Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification.
At the time I was playing around with my home server and I wanted to setup some virtual machines.
My home server was already acting as a home theatre PC at the time and it was running Debian Linux.
As a result of this, I decided to use **KVM**, **QEMU** and **libvirtd** as a hypervisor for these virtual machines.
This hypervisor setup also came in handy when I needed to create labs for the Kubernetes certification
so  thought it was a good idea to share this knowledge online and I decided to write the articles for
[Tadaweb](https://tadaweb.com) on [Medium](https://medium.com) in a three part series:

* [Creating a Professional Home Lab Setup - Part 1: Installing the Operating System](https://medium.com/tadaweb/creating-a-professional-home-lab-setup-part-1-installing-the-operating-system-cfb4839fc796)
* [Creating a Professional Home Lab Setup - Part 2: Configuration of the Hypervisors](https://medium.com/tadaweb/creating-a-professional-home-lab-setup-part-2-configuration-of-the-hypervisors-8a19c44813e5)
* [Creating a Professional Home Lab Setup - Part 3: Virtual Machine Management](https://medium.com/tadaweb/creating-a-professional-home-lab-setup-part-3-virtual-machine-management-cf4e5f64c0ac) 

Even though I must admit that there are other, easier solutions to create labs for the CKA,
the articles are still useful for people that want to learn how to work with kvm directly.

Going forward I plan to write some technical articles and tutorials about infrastructure deployments,
automation, workflow optimizations and other things I find helpful and/or useful.
If this excites you, feel free to subscribe to my [RSS feed](/index.xml).

**P.S.:** This website is statically generated with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) but,
I plan to add a comment system using something like [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) in the future.
